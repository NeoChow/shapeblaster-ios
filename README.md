## Notes

ShapeBlaster for iOS is a port of ShapeBlaster for XNA / C# by Michael Hoffman.

The primary language used in this port is C++, and the primary API is OpenGL ES 2.0. There's also a light mix of some custom classes (called the **Utility library**) I've written to act as an impromptu game framework.

  * **Debug mode runs slower than Release mode!** To enable release mode:
    * Choose **Edit Scheme** from the **Product** menu.
    * Select **Run ShapeBlaster** from the left pane in the window that appears.
    * In the right pane, make sure **Info** is the selected tab.
    * In the right pane, select **release** in the **Build Configuration** setting.
    * Hit the **OK** button
    * **Build** and **Run**. You'll definitely notice speed improvements.
  * **Bloom Post-processing** is possible, though I was not able to get it running at a decent framerate, so it's been omitted.
  * **Warping Grid** uses 600 points rather than the original's 1600 as it's spring / physics and drawing calculations are very expensive.
  * **The iOS simulator** runs slower than actual hardware; you'll see best performance on actual hardware.
  * **72 DPI** is the correct resolution for textures on iOS / Mac. Other DPIs can give unexpected performance. Since XNA uses 96 DPI, the images from the original project had to be resampled.
